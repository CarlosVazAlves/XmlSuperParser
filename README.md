# XmlSuperParser

This project was born because I could not find a XML parser library that was easy to use.
Just upload the file and get the result free from hassle.
It started with the single purpose of read a XML file and parse it to a generic object.
If several people show interest, I'm considering an expansion to further add some more functionality.

This is what I have in mind:
- Reads a XML file and returns a generic XmlElement - Done
- Reads a XML file and returns an instance of an object specified by the user
- Converts a generic XmlElement to a XML file
- Converts an instance of an object specified by the user to a XML file
- Use parallel parsing to increase performance in large files (still wondering if I want to fight such battle....)

If something is not working right, send me the file that caused the problem.

I will improve this file soon to better explain the Xml structure.
